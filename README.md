# NeuroLink AI - Futuristic Landing Page

## Description

NeuroLink AI is a conceptual landing page for a next-generation neural interface technology company. This project showcases a futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired design that presents the idea of connecting human consciousness directly to artificial intelligence. The page is designed for tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and anyone interested in the future of human-computer interaction. It solves the problem of presenting complex, cutting-edge technology in an engaging and visually striking way that captures attention and communicates value instantly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** - Advanced styling with animations, gradients, and grid/flexbox layouts
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** - Smooth scrolling and scroll-triggered reveal animations
- **Modern Web Standards** - Responsive design, CSS custom properties, and transform animations

## Features

1. **Animated Hero Section** - Eye-catching floating orbs with smooth animations and gradient text effects.
2. **Interactive Feature Cards** - Hover effects with glow animations.
3. **Smooth Scrolling** - JavaScript-powered navigation that smoothly glides to sections when links are clicked.
4. **Scroll Reveal** - Content gently fades in and floats up as you scroll down the page.
5. **Responsive Grid Layouts** - Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

**Yes, AI was used in this project.**

- **Tool:** Claude (Anthropic) & Gemini (Google)
- **Assistance provided:** - **Claude:** Initial HTML structure, CSS styling concepts, color scheme, and animation keyframes.
  - **Gemini:** Added Authentication UI pages (`login.html`, `signup.html`), implemented the JavaScript for smooth scrolling and scroll reveal animations (`script.js`), and updated the navigation structure.
- **Human contribution:** Code review, customization of design elements, and final integration of all files.

## Learning Reflection

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of CSS animations and how to enhance them with JavaScript. Implementing the smooth scroll manually gave me insight into how single-page navigation works under the hood. I also learned how to use `IntersectionObserver` for efficient scroll-triggered animations instead of relying on heavy scroll event listeners.

## How to Run

1. Download all files (`index.html`, `login.html`, `signup.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`)
2. Ensure they are in the same directory
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
4. No additional dependencies or server required
